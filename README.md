## Classes in the dataset
The IIITDMJ Smoke dataset is a classification dataset which contains 23, 644 images of wildfire smoke and other images. The images are obtained from diverse geographical locations. To prepare the dataset, a total of 11,604 images were collected from MODIS satellite imagery; 4784 images containing smoke, 6820 clear images (without smoke), and 564 hazy images without fog. The data was augmented by adding synthetic fog to the images, and in this way, the final dataset was created with images under four categories – (a) images without smoke ('clear') (b) images with fog but without smoke ('foggy') (c) images containing smoke ('smokey') (d) images with both smoke and fog ('foggy and smokey'). Synthetic fog was not added in 992 clear images in which the fog made no difference. These images were mostly those covering snow, clouds, and water bodies. The total 23, 644 images are divided into four categories with 6,820 in 'clear' category, 6,692 in 'foggy', 4,784 in 'smokey', 5,348 in 'foggy and smokey'.

## Geographical location of the collected images
The collected images are of resolutions ranging from 210 × 211 to 1094 × 916 pixels; each pixel covers 1 square kilometer of area. The images are obtained from diverse geographical locations. These include images from Canada, Australia, Russia, and the United States of America (USA). Images from the USA are from southern states like Washington, Idaho, San Francisco, California, Helena, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, and Alabama. The vegetation type in California is covered with grasslands and woodlands. From Australia, the states of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland are covered. It may be mentioned that the coastal region of eastern Australia is prone to forest fires, especially in the regions of eucalyptus forests. The collected images contain land areas, water bodies, both land and water bodies. The land areas contain barren land and vegetation. To generate a dataset with a wide range of characteristics and challenging scenarios, images comprising clouds and smoke are also collected.

## Time duration of data collection
During the collection of the IIITDMJ Smoke dataset, the focus was on gathering data of 21st century wildfires. The data was collected based on the occurrence of some major wildfire occurrences such as Russian wildfires in the years 2003, and 2015, Australian bushfires between the years 2002-2003, 2006-2007, 2011-2012, and 2019-2020, Canada wildfires in 2014 and 2017, California fire in 2020, and Bolivia fire in 2010. The vast areas of Amazon rainforests frequently burn due to wildfire. Thus we have also covered wildfires that occurred in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru in the year 2019. The use of the MODIS satellite imagery for data collection was based on its spatial properties, making it well-suited for various Earth observation applications.
